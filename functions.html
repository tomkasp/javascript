Javascript functions invocation types.

There are four ways how you can invoke functions in javascript. If you want to develop high quality code it's crucial to
understand all of them. What are the differences between them and when to use them.

1. Invocation as a function.

This is the basic way. Let's see the example:


The most important thing from this example is that when you invoke function this way function context is global window
context. When you refer to the this inside such a function you refer directly to the window object.

2. Invocation as a method


This time first we need to create javascript object with at least one function inside. Next type object reference and run
function as a normal in first example but on our object. The bigest difference between first and second execution type is
with function context. In second example this is our object. In different way - everything within { } is our context
(our context is 'this')
Thanks to above javascript can be used as an object oriented language.

3 Invocation as a constructor

To invoke function as a constructor you just need to run your function with new keyword

See this example:



Why it's different than other types? Guess what - again difference is with context of our function. When you
invoke it as a constructor few things are happening:
- Empty object is created
- Our Empty object is passed to our function as a this and becomes function context
- in case of lack return statement this is returned


Last method is with invoking apply() and call() methods and I'm going to cover it in separate blog post
